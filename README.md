# CS350-Projects

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Milestone 3 involved a state machine that was programmed to send two messages in Morse Code using different colored LEDs. A button could toggle between these messages, but a message in progress would always conclude before switching to the next message.

The final project, the thermostat, required a task scheduler that checked for button presses, ambient temperature, and the state at varying times. It would then report the device status, and the LEDs would either be solid or utilize PWM depending on the logic for the current status.

## What did you do particularly well?
I wasn't initially confident with creating state machine diagrams, but by the end of the course I believe I did a solid job at conveying my programming thoughts in a cohesive and easily understandable manner.

## Where could you improve?
I encountered the most difficulty with debugging, and found it a time-consuming process to continue tweaking, overwriting, and re-extracting the software with each iteration.

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
CS-350 has provided me with new experiences, such as assembling hardware and how my programming could communicate with it. It was a very unique learning opportunity compared to the rest of the curriculum thus far.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
These projects were my first introduction to working with peripheral devices, and one of my own design.  A valuable lesson I learned was that it isn't always a software issue.  I spent a long time trying to get my 16x2 LCD Display to work properly, only to discover that I had wires crossed on my breadboard.

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Utilizing the best coding practices, including in-line comments, simple and descriptive variable naming schemes, and breaking projects into modular components to improve readability and flow.
